# Pig Game ðŸŽ²

Welcome to the Pig Game! This is a simple and fun dice game where two players compete to be the first to reach a score of 100. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
2. **Gameplay**:
   - On each turn, a player rolls the die as many times as they want. Each result is added to their turn score.
   - If a player rolls a `1`, their turn ends and their turn score is lost.
   - The player can choose to "Hold" at any time, which will add their turn score to their total score and pass the turn to the other player.
3. **Winning**: The first player to accumulate 100 points wins the game.
